# WELCOME TO THE P6 SHORT PROJECT : YOUR ML TEMPLATE - FROM (almost) SCRATCH TO PREDICTION

I don't know exactly why I am writing in english but that came out and I figured it would be a pretty good exercise for you. So here we go. 
To begin with, find and download the famous adult dataset from the official repository.

At this point you should have two datasets : one is the train set with 32561 observations and the second is the test set with 16281 observations.

The objective is to predict the income of the individuals in the test set using the tools you now are getting familiar with.
As to do so, you will have to :
1. Analyse and visualize the dataset.
2. Go through all the preprocessing steps in order to fit at least two different models and compare them after of course having tuned the hyperparameters for each model.

**THIS PROJECT IS DUE TO TOMORROW 17:00**

**Indications:** for those who feel confortable, you can try to use the sklearn pipeline class but this is not an obligation nor a necessity. Feel free to experiment. Just remind that deadline is tomorrow 16:00 and there won't be no extra time for once...


# Deliverables
1. your Python code
2. an **EXACTLY-5-minutes** presentation of your approach and results. The presentation itself doesn't have to be an english-speaking exercise but you can have your slides written in english. That would be another good exercise. Up to you.
